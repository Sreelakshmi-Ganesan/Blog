            <h2>My Struggle with Powernaps</h2>
            <p><small>Published on Oct 10, 2024</small></p>
            <p>It all starts with a simple goal: a quick 10-minute nap. But somewhere along the way, time slips away, and I wake up feeling like I've entered a different time zone:</p>

            <h3>The 10-Minute Promise</h3>
            <p>I tell myself, "Just 10 minutes," but before I know it, an hour has passed, and I'm in a deep slumber. How did that happen?</p>

            <h3>The 2-Hour Nap</h3>
            <p>Eventually, I gave up on the whole "short nap" idea. Now, I embrace the 2-hour nap, and while it’s great, it leaves me groggy and disoriented when I wake up. But at least I feel rested!</p>

            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>Despite my battles with the clock, I’ve learned to accept that some naps are just meant to be longer than planned. Maybe next time, I'll just set an alarm.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>If you’ve ever found yourself in the powernap paradox, you know the struggle is real. But who can resist the sweet temptation of an extra hour of sleep?</p>
